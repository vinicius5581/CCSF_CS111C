1. Connected graph for a pentagon:
             0

		0         0
		 \       / 
		  0  -  0

             0
		  /     \ 
		0         0
		 \       / 
		  0     0

Connected Graph: a graph that has a path between every pair of distinct vertices. 
		  
2. Describe each graph in Figure 22:
a. Disconnected
b. Complete
c. Complete 

3. Consider a graph that represents acquaintance among people. Each vertex represents 
a person. Each edge represents an acquaintance between two people. 
a. Is this graph directed or undirected? 
This graph is undirected because if the edge serves as an acquaintance then the two 
people are mutually (equally) connected with one another via acquaintance and there 
is nothing to indicate a directionality of a relationship. 
b. Consder all verticies adjacent to a given vertex x. What does this set of vertices 
represent? These verticies around x represent people that x is linked with by one 
degree of acquaintanence.  
c. What does a path in this graph represent? A path represents the number of acquaintance
a person is removed from another person. 
d. In what circumstance might one want to know the shortest path between two vertices
in this graph? It could be possible for someone to know how likely they might have met
someone via aqcuaintance and the path that has the least number would give probabilty 
of people having met eachother. It is also showing us how far removed people are from
getting to know/meet another person. 
e. Is this graph connected? No. There can be a circumstance where a person had lost 
all of their aqcuaintance and now they are disconnected from everyone else. Given the
number of people this can be viewed as a possiblity that cannot be ruled out. As such,
it can be said that this is not a connected graph.

4.In what order does a breadth-first traversal visit the vertices in the graph in Fig.10?

G: H
H: I

5. Repeat (4) but with depth-first traversal.

6. Consider directed graph in Fig10. Remove edge between E and F
and edge between F and H.
a. In what order will breadth-first traversal visit vertices when
you begin at vertex A?

-first create new adjacency list
A: B D E
B: E
C: B
D: G
E: H
F: C
G: H
H: I
I: F

-breadth-first uses a queue

1. What adjacency matrix represents the graph below?
  A B C D E F G H I 
A   1   1 1   
B         1
C   1 
D             1
E           1   1 
F     1         1
G               1
H                 1
I            1

2. What adjaceny matrix represnets the graph below?
  A B C D E F G H I 
A   2   5 4   
B         1
C   3 
D             2
E           3   6 
F     4         3
G               1
H                 1
I            1

3. What adjaceny lists represent the graph in (1)?
adjacency list (alphabetical)
A: B, D, E
B: E
C: B
D: G
E: F, H
F: C, H
G: H
H: I
I: F

4. Same as (3). 

5. When is adjaceny matrix just as space-efficient as adjacency list?
We know that for a sparce graph, an adjacency list uses less memory than
an adjaceny matrix. For a dense graph, an adjaceny matrix can be better. 
As such, when the graph is about half full then using either can be 
just as space-efficient. 

6. Adjacency matrix. 

7. Adjacency matrix.
